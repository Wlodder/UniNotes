= Grammar based modelling =

* We can define objects using simple grammar production

* Trace out path using commands like:
	- F = move 1 unit forwards
	- L = turn left through angle $\theta$
	- R = turn right through angle $\theta$

== Example of grammar-based modelling ==
* We can apply the rule reculsivly replacing each $F$ again (suitable transformed) using the rule
* $ F \rightarrow FLFRRFLF$
This reproduces a fractal called the Kock curve, whose detail depends on the number recursive replacements have occured.

= L-systems =

* L-systems add push ( and pop ) commands, which permit more complex structures
* Example: $ F \rightarrow F[RF]F[LF]F$ (the [] denote a separate branch)
