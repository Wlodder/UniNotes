The Title of the project is 'Image classification via brain-like learning in neural networks' under the supervision of Oliver Rhodes
Sections covered in this wiki are based off personal notes taken during the development and research of the topic.
The bulk of the project is based off 'Unsupervised learning of digit recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasicity' by Peter U.Diehl and Matthew Cook (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full#h3).
Whilst a majority of the research was done using the book 'Neuronal Dynamics' by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski (https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/index.html). 
The implementation's main sources are the SpiNNaker workshops and various tutorials on PyNN, check the SpiNNaker github pages and website for the most update tutorials.
