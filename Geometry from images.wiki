= Geometry from images =

When dealing with computation geometry we must essentially deal with 3 coordinate systems: Image plane (2D), Camera frame (3D), World frame (3D). With some key ideas.

The world frame contains the object as in the real world using the 3 dimensional world view.
The camera frame deals with the rotation and location of the camera with respect to the object itself.
The image plane is a distance $F$, away from the camera's optical center (the focal length) and is the area on which the image is projected onto.

Rays of light pass from the object's surface from through the optical center and are projected onto the image plane.


We need to form a relationship between the image frame and world coordinate frame.

If you are wondering why there is an extra dimension for the Image coordinates and the world coordinates, the extra dimension represents a scaling factor.
There are mesured with respect to the center of the image.

Definitions:
* $x_0, y_0$ represent the image origin, the point where the optical center of the camera intersects the image plane.Normally it is the center of the image.
* $ \gamma$ represents the skew
* $ \mathcal{f} $ represents the focal length of the camera in pixels
* $S_{\mathcal{x}} , S_{\mathcal{y}} $ represents the scale on the length of the pixel side, (lengths of a pixel)

== Lens distortion ==

All of these distortions can be modelled using equations of the form

{{$
x' = x ( 1 + \alpha r^2 + \beta r ^ 4 + ...)
}}$

Where $x'$ and $x$ represent the origin and image center,and , $r$ is the distance from the image center (computer using pythagoras). The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients are used to determine how bad the distortion is.
