= Particle Systems =

* Some phenmena are naturally modelled as a set of dynamic particles
* Examples: water, clouds, fire.

Each particle has a set of properties which change over time:
* size, shape colour, opacity
* positin, velocity, acceleration
* age, lifetime

=== example: simple explosion model ===
a = explosion area
c = centre of explosion
e = maximum ejection angle

* For some property P of the particle, we cmpute its initial value using 
  	- $P_{initial}=P_{mean} + (Random()*P_{variance})$ ( basically a distribution)

=== Computing particle position ===

We normally use rules based of Newton's laws of motion

* Compute position of particle at time $t$ using standard equations of motion
* Or ... of course could use any algorithm

{{$
x_{p} = v_{p}*t*cos*\beta_{p} 
}}$
{{$
y_{p} = v_{p}*t*sin*\beta_{p} - \frac{1}{2}gt^{2} 
}}$

* Also bounces...
* (is $y = y_{ground}$)
* If yes, reset particle position, and damp new velocity.

== Efficiency and scalability (see coursework) ==

{{$
v_{t_{i+1}} = v_{t_{i}} + a*\Delta t
}}$
and
{{$
x_{t_{i+1}}=x_{t_{i}} + v * \Delta t
}}$


{{$
x_{t_{i+1}} = 2 * x_{t_{i}} - x_{t_{i-1}} + a * (\Delta t)^{2} 
}}$

=== Particle system algorithm ===

$ \text{For each frame of animation } $

$\quad \text{Remove any particles past their lifetime} $
$\quad \text{Create new particles and initialise them} $
$\quad \text{Update attributes for each particle} $
$\quad \quad \text{Position:}$
$\quad \quad \quad\text{ Detect collisions of particles with environment} $
$\quad \quad \quad \text{inter-particle collisions }$
$\quad \quad \text{Colour, acceleration, etc}$
$\quad \text{Render current particles }$

== Rending ideas ==

* Point based:
	- Space is quantized (in pixels) distribute the particle based off overlap with pixels, anti-aliasing.
* Line based:
	- render the particle's trajectory 
* Distribution based:
	- let the particles location be the location of a gaussian distribution and render from there
* Alpha textured quad:
	- make it transparent, always aligned to face the viewer, think games like wolfenstein.
