= Flow networks =

A flow network is a quintuple $(V, E, s, t, c)$ where $(V,E)$ is a directed graph with no back-loops, $s, t \in V$ are distinct, and $c : E \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $

Let $ N = (V,E,s,t,c) $ be a flow network. A flow in $N$ is a function $f:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ with the following properties:
* The net flow out of any node $u=(V \ \{ s, t \})$ is zero: 
  {{$
  \sum _{v;(u,v) \in E} f(u,v) - \sum _{v; (v, u) \in E} f(v,u) = 0
  }}$
* No edge $(u,v) \in E$ exceeds its capacity:
  {{$
  f(u,v) <= c(u,v)
  }}$
  
  
The value of $f$ is a quantity:

{{$
\sum _{v; (s,v) \in E} f(s,v)

}}$

or, equivalently:

{{$
\sum _{(v,t) \in E} f(v,t)
}}$

A flow is optimal if the outgoing flow from the source is equal to the incoming flow into the sink.
