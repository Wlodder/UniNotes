= Generative Modelling = 

Generate something and then render it later.

=== Why polygons fail ===

We make polygons and then shade them in later, and this works for the most part - looks pretty good, but not everything is a polygon in a natural setting. Waterfalls and a lot of natural phenomena are not easy to render using polygons.

== Fractal Geometry ==

A fractal is a shape that has a certain amount of self similarity at different scales of viewing the pattern. Smaller pieces of brocolli look like zoomed in images of larger pieces of brocolli.

=== How long is a coastline? ===

Really we should ask our selves how long is the unit of measurement we are using. Using a smaller unit we can get a more accurate representation of the coast line but we need more units to get the length. 

* Answer: it depends what ruler you use.

== Modelling fractal curves ==

* How can we model such curves?
* One approach is recurise subdivision
	- Take mid-point of line, displace it randomly
	- Replace first line with two new lines
	- Repeat recursively until required level of detail

This can be done in any number of dimensions.
