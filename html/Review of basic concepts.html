<ul>
<li>
A directed graph is a pair, \( G = (V,E) \), where V is a finite, non-empty set (verticies) and E (edges) a set of ordered (directed) pairs of distinct elements of V.

<li>
If \( e = (u,v) \in E \) is an edge, then u and v are neighbours.

<li>
Directed graphs have:

<ul>
<li>
No self loops

<li>
No multiple edges

<li>
No directionless edges

</ul>
<li>
The in-degree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges similary for the out-degree.

<li>
For us directed graphs are stored as adjacency lists due the potentially asymmetric nature of edges.

<li>
A path is a directed graph is a sequence of distinct vertices such that there is an edge between every vertex

<li>
If \( G = (V,E) \) is a directed graph and \( s,t \in V \), we say that t is reachable from s if there exists a path \( s = u_{0},...,u_{k} = t \) from s to t.

<li>
A directed graph is strongled connected if every vertex is reachable from every other.

</ul>

<p>
These are both examples of decision problems:
</p>

<p>
st-CON
Given: A directed graph \( G = (V,E) \) and vertices \( s,t \in V\).
Return: Yes if t is reachable from s in G, No otherwise.
</p>

<p>
STRONG CONNECTIVITY
Given: A directed graph \( G = (V,E) \)
Return: Yes, if G is strongly connected, No otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Determining strong connectivity in linear time can be done use DFS. 
We know that DFS has the complextiy of \( O(n + m) \) where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges.
Hence we can determine also if two components (vertices) are strongly connected if DFS returns a "Yes" as its output provided it is framed as a decision problems.
In order to frame this as a strong connectivity problem by simplying adding two additional requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\( \forall s \in V ,\exists u_{i},~~such~that~u_{i}(s,t_{i})~for~0~&lt;=~i~&lt;= n \)

<li>
\( \forall t \in V ,\exists u,~~such~that~u(t, s) \)

</ul>

<p>
This states that in order for an entire graph to be strongly connected, choose any vertex as a starting vertex
then perform DFS on every other vertex of the graph. If any vertex is unreachable G is not strongly connected and stop.
Likewise perform DFS from every other node back to the start node. If every node has a path back to the home node then the graph is strongly connected. Due to transitivity of paths hence every node can reach every node.
This is done in:
</p>
\[
O( 2 * (n - 1) * O(DFS))~=~O( 2 * (n - 1) * (n + m) ) 
\]
