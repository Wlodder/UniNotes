<ul>
<li>
A* algorithms an importatn algorithm is an artificial intelligence.

<li>
Dijkstra's algorithm

<li>
Greedy heuristic

</ul>

<div id="Heuristics-What is a heuristic ?"><h2 id="What is a heuristic ?" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-What is a heuristic ?">What is a heuristic ?</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Rules which are applied becuase they are found to have worked.

<li>
By trial and error

</ul>

<p>
We can abstract a state space as weighted graphs. So think of it like a tree of alternate realities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nodes : represent the states of the puzzle.

<li>
Edges : An edge from noeds i to j represent a direct move from state i to state j.

<li>
Weights : c(i,j) represents positive distances (time or costs) associated with the move from i to j.

</ul>

<div id="Heuristics-Dijkstra's algorithm"><h2 id="Dijkstra's algorithm" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-Dijkstra's algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Finds the shortest path from source to all other nodes in graph.

<li>
Searches nodes nearest to source node first (priority queue)

<li>
When a node is popped from the priority queue, the shortest path to it has been found.

<li>
The algorithm is complete

<li>
Finds the shortest path

</ul>

<p>
How would a human sovle these problems?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Move to the available state x seemingly "closest to the goal"

<li>
Requires a "heuristic" function:

</ul>

\[
	h(x)=\text{estimated distance from node x to the goal}
	
\]
<ul>
<li>
Repeatedly move to the availabe node x' connected to state x with the lowest value of h(x')

</ul>

<div id="Heuristics-Greedy heuristic search"><h2 id="Greedy heuristic search" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-Greedy heuristic search">Greedy heuristic search</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Uses a heuristic h(x) approximation for the distnace to the goal

<li>
Not complete - will not necessarily find a path

<li>
Does not necessarily find the optimal path

<li>
Fast

<li>
Informed 

<li>
can be complete with backtracking

</ul>

<div id="Heuristics-A* algorithm"><h2 id="A* algorithm" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-A* algorithm">A* algorithm</a></h2></div>

<p>
A* algorthim combines the two algorithms.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
g(x) the distance from the source s to the node x

<ul>
<li>
 The distance from dijkstra's to the node

</ul>
<li>
h(x) the distance from the node x to the target node

<ul>
<li>
The heuristic's distance

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
A* algorithm is dijkstra's but instead the weights we use are:
g(x) + h(x) as the weight.
</p>
  
  
<div id="Heuristics-what makes a good heuristic"><h2 id="what makes a good heuristic" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-what makes a good heuristic">what makes a good heuristic</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
admissible

<ul>
<li>
The distance from all nodes to the goal is less than the true shortest distance

<li>
i.e. h underestimates the distnace to the goal

<li>
h(x) should be optimistic

</ul>
<li>
monotonic - obey's the triangle inequality

<ul>
<li>
A heuristic is called monotonic or consistnent if for all children y of x. \( h(x) &lt;= c(x,y) + h(y) \)

</ul>
<li>
informative - as close to the true distance without exceeding it

<ul>
<li>
h(x) is the true shortest distance to the goal.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Heuristics-Can we apply these ideas to games?"><h2 id="Can we apply these ideas to games?" class="header"><a href="#Heuristics-Can we apply these ideas to games?">Can we apply these ideas to games?</a></h2></div>

<p>
No!, But, ...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The heuristic h(x) is a "state evaluation" function.

<li>
In games, we use board evaluation functions.

</ul>
<p>
But the search algorithms must be modified (to take into account the other players - potentially negative)
