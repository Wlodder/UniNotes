<p>
Goal: Given a grammar, G, construct a parse tree for a string (i.e. sentence) by starting at the leaves and wokring to the root (i.e. by working from the input sentence back toward the start symbol S).
</p>

<p>
Recall: the point of parsing is to construct a derivation:
</p>

<p>
$$
S \rightarrow \delta _0 \rightarrow \delta _1 ... \rightarrow \delta _{n-1} \rightarrow sentence
$$
</p>

<p>
To derive \(\delta _{i-1} \) from \(\delta _i\) we match some rhs b in \(\delta _i\), the replace b with its corresponding lhs, A. This is called a reduction (it assumes \(A \rightarrow b\)).
</p>

<p>
The parse tree is the result of the tokens and the reductions. Think of these reduction similarly to the moden potens resolution in Prolog.Its basically top down in reverse.
</p>

<div id="Bottom-up Parsing-Finding Resolutions"><h2 id="Finding Resolutions" class="header"><a href="#Bottom-up Parsing-Finding Resolutions">Finding Resolutions</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
What are we trying to find?

<ul>
<li>
A substring b that matches the right-side of a production that occurs as one step in the right most derivation. Informally, this substring is called a handle.

</ul>
<li>
Formally, a handle of a right-sentential form \(\delta\) is a pair \(&lt; A \rightarrow b, k &gt;\), where \(A \rightarrow b \in P \) and k is the position in \(\delta\) of b's rightmost symbol. 	(right-sentential form: a sentential form that occurs in some right most derivation)

<ul>
<li>
Because \(\delta\) is a right-sentential form, the substring to the right of a handle contains only terminal symbols. Therefore, the parser doesn't need to scan past the handle.

<li>
If a grammar is unambiguous, then every right-sentential form has a unique handle (sketch of proof by definition: if unambiguous then rightmost derivation is unique; then there is a unique production at each step to produce a sentential form; then there is a unique position at which the rule is applied;  hence, unique handle).

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
If we can find the handles, we can build the derivation.
</p>

<p>
The way I like to think of the handles is they are in the form &lt;rule number, part of the string we are reducing&gt;. This can be seen in the examples from the lectures.

<ul>
<li>
The process of discovering a handle is called handle pruning.

<li>
To construct a rightmost derivation, apply the simple algorithm:

</ul>

<p>
$$%align
\begin{tabular}[|]
\textbf{for} i =n ~to~1, step ~ -1 &amp; \\
&amp; \textbf{find} \text{the handle } &lt;A \rightarrow b, k &gt;_i in \delta_i \\
&amp; \textbf{replace } \text{b with A to generate } \delta _{i-1} 
</p>

<p>
$$
</p>

<p>
This needs 2n steps, where n is the length of the derivation.
</p>

<p>
One implementation is based on using a stack to hold grammar symbols and an input buffere to hold the string to be parsed. Four operations apply:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
shift : next input is shifted (pushed) onto the top of the stack

<li>
reduce : right-end of the handle is on the top of the stack; locate left-end of the handle within the stack; pop handle off stack and push appropriate non-terminal left-hand-side symbol

<li>
accept : terminate parsing and signal success

<li>
error :  call an error recovery routine.

</ul>

<p>
Things to think about:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Shift/reduce conflicts: the parser cannot decide whether to shift or to reduce.

<ul>
<li>
Example: the dangling-else grammar; usually due to eambiguous grammars

<li>
Solution a) modify the grammar b) resolve in favour of a shift

</ul>
<li>
Reduce/ reduce conflicts: the parser cannot decide which of several reduction to make.

<ul>
<li>
Example: id(id, id); the reduction is dependent on whether the first id refers to array or function.

<li>
May be difficult to tackle.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Key to efficient bottom-up parsing: the handle-finding mechanisms.

<div id="Bottom-up Parsing-LR(1) Grammars"><h2 id="LR(1) Grammars" class="header"><a href="#Bottom-up Parsing-LR(1) Grammars">LR(1) Grammars</a></h2></div>

<p>
A grammar is LR(1) if, given a rightmost derivation , we can 1) isolate the handle of each right-sentential form, and 2) detemine the production by which to reduce, by scanning the sentential form from left-to-right, going at most 1 symbol beyond the right-end of the handle.
</p>

<p>
LR(1) grammars are widely used to construct (automatically) efficient) and flexible pasers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Virtually all CFG language constructs can be expressed in an LR(1) form.

<li>
LR grammars are the most general grammars parsable by a non-backtracking, shift-reduce parser (Deterministic CFG).

<li>
Parsers can be implemented in time proportional to tokens+reductions.

<li>
LR parsers detect an error as soon as possible in a left-to-right scan of the input.

</ul>

<p>
Reading tokens from an input buffer (same as with shift-reduce parsers)
Add an extra state informatino after each symbol in the stack. The stae summarises the information contained in the stack below it. The stakc would look like:
</p>

<p>
$$
S_0~Expr~S_1 ~-~S_2~num~S_3
$$
</p>

<p>
We also use an additional table to tell us the next state to add given a replacement:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
action[state_on_top_of_stack, input_symbol] : returns one of: shift s(push a symbol and a state); reduce by a rule; accept; error.

<li>
goto[state_on_top_of_stack; non_terminal_symbol]: returns a new state to push onto the stack after a reduction.

</ul>
