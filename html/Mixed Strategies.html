<p>
A mixed strategy is a strategy which involves a probabilistic approach with pure strategies.
We can play in both normal form (tableau) and in extensive form (tree), assigning a probability function for each choice that sum to one.
</p>

<div id="Mixed Strategies-Celebrated theorems"><h3 id="Celebrated theorems" class="header"><a href="#Mixed Strategies-Celebrated theorems">Celebrated theorems</a></h3></div>

<p>
John von Neumann (1928) : von Neumann showed that every zero-sum game with perfect informatin has solutins which minimise the maximum lsses for the players, but mixed strategies may be required von Neumann invented game theory as a mathematical discipline.
</p>

<p>
Nash (1950) : Every game with a finite number of players in which each player has a finite number of pure strategies has at last ne Nash equilbrium. Some will involve mixed strategies.

<div id="Mixed Strategies-When mixed strategies are needed"><h2 id="When mixed strategies are needed" class="header"><a href="#Mixed Strategies-When mixed strategies are needed">When mixed strategies are needed</a></h2></div>

<p>
Mixed strategies can be required when there is hidden information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Extensive form games with hidden information (e.g. poker)

<li>
Normal frm games always have hidden information (the hidden strategy of the opponents)

</ul>


<div id="The simplest example"><h1 id="The simplest example" class="header"><a href="#The simplest example">The simplest example</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Two brothers Donald (older) and Eric ( younger) go to the same high school

<li>
There are two cafes in the school: Red and Blue where they lunch every day.

<li>
Donald wants to be in a different cafe then little brother

<li>
but Eric always wants to be near big brother.

</ul>

<p>
Each chooses the lunch spot probabilistically.
</p>

<p>
Donald chooses Red with probability \(x\), therefore choosing Blue with probability \(1 - x\).
Eric chooses Red with probability \(y\), likewise the same as Donald's choice for blue: \(1-y\) .
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Since the strategies are probabilistic, so are the payoffs.

<li>
S we need the expected payoffs.

<li>
Let \(U_1 (S_1 , S_2 ) \) is the payoff to Player 1 for a given set of pure strategies, \(( S_1 , S_2)\)

<li>
Expected payoff is \(Ex \[ U_1 (S_1, S_2 ) \] \).

</ul>

<p>
If Eric always goes to Red cafe:
</p>

\begin{align}

Exc \[ U_{1} (s_{1} (x) , Red ) \] &amp; = (-1) x + (1) ( 1 - x) \\
&amp; 1 - 2 x 

\end{align}

<p>
If Eric always goes to Blue cafe:
</p>

\begin{align}

Ex \[ U_{1} ( S_{1} (x), Blue ) \] &amp; = (1) x - (-1) (1 - x) \\
&amp; 2 x - 1
\end{align}

<p>
<span id="The simplest example-Optimising Donald's decision-Task"></span><strong id="Task">Task</strong>: find the value of \(x\) such that:
</p>

\begin{align}

Ex \[ U_{1} ( S_{1} (x), Red) \] &amp; = Ex \[ U_{1} ( S_{1} ( x ) , Blue ) \] 
\end{align}

<p>
If they are not equal then :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Eric will have a pure strategy best response

<li>
Then Donald's best respnse will be a pure strategy 

<li>
But there is no pure stategy Nash equilibrium!

<p>
A common feature of mixed strategy Nash equilibria
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If one player plays its component of the mixed Nash equilibrium, the payoff is indifferetn to what the other player does.

<li>
The other player must also play its component of the Nash equilibrium to force the first player to play its cmpoonent and not take advantage.

</ol>


<div id="The simplest example-Key ideas"><h2 id="Key ideas" class="header"><a href="#The simplest example-Key ideas">Key ideas</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Introduce probabilities over pure strategies

<li>
Set the expected payoffs against each opponents's pure strategy to be equal to find the value of the probabilites

<li>
With 2-action, 2-player gamnes, Nash equilibria can be found graphically.
