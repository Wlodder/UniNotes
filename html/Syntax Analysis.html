<p>
Lexical Analysis: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reads characters of the input program an produces tokens

<ul>
<li>
But: Are they syntactically correct? Are they valid sentences of the input language

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The descriptive power of regular expressions has limits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Not all languages can be described by Regular Expressions (See the chomsky hierarchy)

<li>
An example is the example of a nested expression since regular languages do not have memory.

<li>
In regular expressinos, a non-terminal symbol cannot be used before it has been fully defined.

</ul>

<p>
Chomsky's hierarchy of Grammars:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Phrase structured

<li>
Context Sensitive

<ul>
<li>
number of Left Hand Side Symbols is less than or equal to the number of right hand symbols

</ul>
<li>
Context-free

<ul>
<li>
The Left Hand Side Symbol is non-terminal

</ul>
<li>
regular

<ul>
<li>
Only rules of the form: \( A \rightarrow \epsilon, A \rightarrow a, A \rightarrow p B\)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
the regular languages are the most restricted kind of grammar. 
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars"><h2 id="Context free grammars" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars">Context free grammars</a></h2></div>

<p>
Context free syntax is specified with a context-free grammar.
</p>

<p>
A grammar can be defined as a 4-tuple \(G={S, N, T, P}\), where:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
S is a starting symbol

<li>
N is a set of non-terminal symbols

<li>
T is a set of terminal symbols

<li>
P is a set of production rules

</ul>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Derivations and parse trees"><h3 id="Derivations and parse trees" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Derivations and parse trees">Derivations and parse trees</a></h3></div>

<p>
Derivation: a sequence of derivatino steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
At each step, we choose a non-terminal to replace

<li>
Different choices can lead to different derivations

</ul>

<p>
Two derivations are of interest:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Leftmost derivation: at each step, replace the leftmost non-terminal 

<li>
Rightmost derivation: at each step, replace the rightmost non-terminal

</ul>

<p>
A parse tree is a graphical representation for a derivation that filters out the choice regarding the replacement order.
</p>

<p>
Example:
CFG is:
$$%align%
Goal \rightarrow Expr
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Expr \rightarrow Expr~or~Expr ~|~ number ~ | ~ id
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Op \rightarrow +|-|*|/
$$
</p>


<p>
We can use this to parse the expression, " x - 2 * y "
However in closer inspection to the meaning of the phrase the rightmost and left most derivations give us two meanings: "x - (2 * y)" and "(x - 2) * y". 
The two derivations point out a problem with this grammar in that it has no notion of precedence ( or implied order of evaluation). To add precedence we force the parse to recognise high-precedence subexpressions first using brackets.
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Ambiguity"><h3 id="Ambiguity" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Ambiguity">Ambiguity</a></h3></div>
<p>
A grammar that produces more than one parse tree for some sentence is ambiguous. Or:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If a grammar has more than noe leftmost derivation for a single sentential form, the grammar is ambiguous. 

<li>
If a grammar has more than one rightmost derivation for a single sentential form, the grammar is ambiguous.

</ul>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\(Stmt \rightarrow \text{if Expr then Stmt | if Expr then Stmt else Etmt | ... }\)

<li>
What are the derivations of:

<ul>
<li>
if E1 then if E2 then S1 else S2

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The standard way to get rid of ambiguoity we rewrite the grammar.
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Deeper Ambiguity"><h3 id="Deeper Ambiguity" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Context free grammars-Deeper Ambiguity">Deeper Ambiguity</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Ambiguity usually refers to confusion in the CFG

<li>
Overloading can create deeper ambiguity

<ul>
<li>
E.g.: a=b(3) : b could be either a function or a variable (FORTRAN, C++)

</ul>
<li>
Disambiguating this one requires context:

<ul>
<li>
An issue of type, not context-free syntax

<li>
Needs values of declarations

<li>
Requires an extra-grammatical solution

</ul>
<li>
Resolving ambiguity:

<ul>
<li>
if context-free: rewrite the grammar

<li>
context-sensitive ambiguity: check with other means: needs knowledge of types, declarations, ... This is a language design problem

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes the compiler write accepts an ambiguous grammar: parsing techniques may do the "right thing" but this is not always true.
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Parsing"><h2 id="Parsing" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Parsing">Parsing</a></h2></div>

<p>
Top-down parsers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Construct the top node of the tree and then the rest in pre-order (depth-first)

<li>
Pick a production and try to match the input; if you fail; backtrack

<li>
Essentially , we try to find a leftmost derivation for the input string (which we scan left-to-right).

<li>
some grammars are backtrack-free (predictive parsing)

</ul>

<p>
Bottom-down parsers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Construct the tree for an input string, beginning at the leaves and working up towards the top (root)

<li>
Bottom-up parsing, using left-to-right scan of the input, tries to construct a rightmost derivation in reverse.

<li>
Handle a large class of grammars.

</ul>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Parsing-Top-Down Recursive-Descent Parsing"><h3 id="Top-Down Recursive-Descent Parsing" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Parsing-Top-Down Recursive-Descent Parsing">Top-Down Recursive-Descent Parsing</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Construct the root with the starting symbol of the grammar.

<li>
Repeat until the fringe of the parse tree matches the input string:

<ul>
<li>
Assuming a node labelled A, select a production rule with A on its left-hand-side and, for each symbol on its right-hand-side, construct the appropriate childe.

<li>
When a terminal symbol is added to the fringe and it doesn't match the fringe, backtrack.

<li>
Find the next node to be expanded.

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
The key is picking the right productions in the first step: that choice should be guided by the input string.
</p>


<div id="Syntax Analysis-Parsing-Left-Recursive Grammars"><h3 id="Left-Recursive Grammars" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Parsing-Left-Recursive Grammars">Left-Recursive Grammars</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Definition: a grammar is left-recursive if it has a non-terminal symbol A, such that there is a derivation A -&gt; Aa, for some string a.

<li>
A left-recursive grammar can cause a recursive-descent parser to go into into an infinite loop.

<li>
Eliminating  left-recursion: In many cases, it is sufficient to replace \( A \rightarrow A a | b \) with \( A \rightarrow b A ' \) and \( A' \rightarrow a A' | \epsilon\)

</ul>

<p>
What we have essentially done in the examble above is turn the left recursive grammar into a right recursive grammar. You may think this is counter intuitive however, since we are dealing with leftmost derivation in topdown parsers we do not care about right recursion.
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Where are we?"><h2 id="Where are we?" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Where are we?">Where are we?</a></h2></div>

<p>
We can produce a top-down parser, but if it picks the wrong production rule it has to backtrack.
</p>

<p>
Idea: look ahead in input and use context to pick correctly.
How much lookahead is needed?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
in general, an arbitrarily large amount.

<li>
Fortunately, most programming language constructs fall into subclasses of context-free grammars that can be parsed with limited lookahead.

</ul>


<div id="Syntax Analysis-Predictive Parsing"><h2 id="Predictive Parsing" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Predictive Parsing">Predictive Parsing</a></h2></div>

<p>
The basic idea is to choose a rule that is the correct rule to expand given the context of the thing that we are parsing.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
FIRST sets:

<ul>
<li>
For any symbol A, FIRST(A) is defined as "the set of terminal symbols that appear as the first symbol of one or more strings dervied from A".

<li>
E.g. From the previous grammar: FIRST(Expr) = {+, -, \(\epsilon\)}, FIRST(Term) = {*, /, \(\epsilon\)}, FIRST(Factor) = {number, id}

</ul>
<li>
The LL(1) property:

<ul>
<li>
If \(A \rightarrow a" and " A \rightarrow b" both appear in the grammar, we would like to have: \)FIRST(a) \cup FIRST(b) = \null$. This would allow parser to make a correct choice with a lookahead of exactly one symbol!

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
If LL(1) property is upheld in the grammar then it is possible for the grammar to be deterministic.
</p>

<p>
But what if my grammar does not have the LL(1) property?
</p>

<p>
We can transform it using factoring.
</p>

<div id="Syntax Analysis-Predictive Parsing-Algorithm"><h3 id="Algorithm" class="header"><a href="#Syntax Analysis-Predictive Parsing-Algorithm">Algorithm</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
For each non-terminal A, find the longest prefix, say a, common to two of more of its alternatives

<li>
if \(a \neq \epsilon \) then replace all the A productions, \(A \rightarrow ab_1 | ab_2 | ab_3 | ... | ab_n | \gamma\), where \(\gamma\) is anything that does not begin with a, with \(A \rightarrow aZ | \gamma\) and \(Z \rightarrow b_1 | b_2 | b_3| ... | b_n\)

</ol>
<p>
Repeat the above until no common prefixes remain
