* Best response strategy
	- A best response strategy is the strategy for a given player which yield the highest payoff to that player given the strategies of al the other players.
* Nash Equilibrium
	- A strategy prfile $( s^{*}_{1} , s^{*}_{2}, ..., s_{k}^{*})$ for a game with k players, is a Nash equilibrium if each strategy is a best response to all of the others.
	- It is not a strategy; it is a choice of strategy for all players in the game
	- It the players are playing the Nash, no player has any incentive to change its strategy unilaterally


* Only for a speciall class of games do strategies which beat all opponents always exist (two-player, zero-sum, perfect informatin, no chance)
* A Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies for all players such that each player is playing best response to all the others.
* For a zero-sum, two-player game in normal form , a strategy pair which is maximal in its columns and minimal in its rows is a Nash equilibrium.
* Dominance can be used to reduce the number of strategies
* Nash equilibria als exist in general-sum games.
