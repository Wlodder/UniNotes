== An example of SAT ==

* Let $\Gamma$ be a set of (logical) clauses
* Suppose there exists $\gamma (l_1 \or ... \or l_m) \in \Gamma$ with $m \geq 4$

It is obvious any new clauses derived must be entailed from the previous clauses, i.e. the clauses do not lose validity inbetween.

* Supposed the assignment $theta$ satisfies $\Gamma $ .
* Then setting $\theta (p) = \theta ( l_1 \or l_2) $ yields an assigment satisfying $\Gamma '$

* now repeat this process to exhaustion
* We eventually obatian a set of clauses $\Gamma *$, equisatisfiable with $\Gamma$ , such that all clauses in $\Gamma *$ 
  
* Moral : SAT is 'not essentiall harder than ' 3-SAT because there exists a polynomial time algorithm to movre between them.
